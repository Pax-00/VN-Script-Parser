    "Yuuji": "Ace number 9029, Yuuji is the \"janitor\" for the underworld. Tired of his life, he wanted to live a normal school life. Cool, philosophical, and minimalist, Yuuji is a realist (but also a tsundere). Being very cautious, he always plans and scouts before action. Other than his occasional orthodontic military methods, he's just a fit young man. He disguised himself as \"exchange student from Canada\"."
